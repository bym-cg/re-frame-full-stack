== Setup

First, install the dependencies with npm:

    yarn

Then, you can start the frontend service with:

    clj -M:frontend

You find the application at http://localhost:8700.

Start the backend API with this alias:

    clj -M:api

Find the backend server at: http://localhost:3000/ping

There are some more aliases, which can typically be used at hobby projects.

=== CSS

To compile sass, install `sassc` and use the following command to watch for changes:

    sass --watch ./resources/public/css/main.scss  ./resources/public/css/main.css

== Using Calva

When you are using Calva, you can start frontend and backend in one REPL Session by using the jack-in command, then choosing `deps.edn` and `:frontend` as the preferred alias.
